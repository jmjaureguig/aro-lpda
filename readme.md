# ARO LPDA

* 8 log-periodic antennas
  + Separation 1-m, no pattern specified (1x8, 2x4, 3x3).
  + Semipermanent for a 6-months deployment.
* Ground plane.
* 8 RF-chains.
* Recording machine.
* Network gateway computer.


## Taskt to coordinate with Ben & Caroline.
* [ ] Define installation place.
  + Share pointing with CHIME.
  + Close to the basement.

## Tasks for Toronto
* [ ] Identify and order the antennas.
  + Order placed, waiting for them to arrive.
* [ ] Identify and order the analog chain component or maybe the cables.
  + In progress.
* [ ] Identify and order the computers.
* [ ] Recording computer with big memory (I have the old moose in my office, can we borrow some of the parts of it, need to spec it out).
* [ ] Network gateway computer (boris, we have the plan to buy it).
* [ ] Testing the antenna and analog chain.
* [ ] Install the computer os and software and test it out (Not sure how to test it without an iceboard (maybe lwlab has one)).
* [ ] Depending on the antenna mounting plan, we may need to build the mounting base.

## Tasks for ARO
* [ ] Shipping equipment to ARO?
* [ ] Install the antennas mounting to a solid base (Need to think about the snow environment) ** We will have to get a precise measurement of antenna locations and layout.
* [ ] Connect the cables between the analog chain and FPGA
* [ ] Integration test.
* [ ] Record crab pulses.
* [ ] Calibration of beamforming?
